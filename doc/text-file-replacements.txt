You could use replacements for following tags in files of clues/solutions/hints:

<key>    - will be replaced with the actual code defined in metadata.ini
           (replaced in solution files only)

<file-[type][number]> - will be replaced with filename of given file from current directory
        [type] should be 'c', 'h' or 's' where:
               'c' stands for Clue file
               'h' stands for Hint file
               's' stands for Solution file

        [number] is the numebr of the file of given type in the directory.
                 Files are numbered from 1 in alphabetical order.

<hint-cnt> - will be replaced with the actual number of hints defined in the directory
<timeout>  - will be replaced with the actual timeout defined in metadata.ini
